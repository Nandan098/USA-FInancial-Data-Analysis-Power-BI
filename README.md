# USA-FInancial-Data-Analysis-Power-BI
This project presents an end-to-end automated solution for processing and analyzing U.S. financial survey data. The primary goal was to eliminate a previously manual and error-prone workflow in which ~25 daily files were received via email, downloaded, merged, cleaned, and transformed to build a dashboard.
